    "### Project Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Workflow File Creation\n",
    "  - I created a *.github* directory, followed by a *workflows* subdirectory to house the GitHub Actions workflow file.\n",
    "  - The workflow file, [weather_data.yml](https://github.com/Gtalen/computer_infrastructure/blob/main/.github/workflows/weather_data.yml), was used to define the automation process.\n",
    "  - Resources for creating the workflow included GitHub Actions documentation, crontab tutorials, and detailed prompting from ChatGPT-4.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Workflow Definition\n",
    "  - The script is set to execute at 10 AM daily.\n",
    "  - It runs on the latest Ubuntu version, ensuring compatibility with the script.\n",
    "  - The workflow includes a git repository checkout step.\n",
    "  - A workflow_dispatch trigger is added to allow for manual initiation and testing.\n",
    "  - The chmod step ensures the script has executable permissions.\n",
    "  - The script then executes the [weather.sh](https://github.com/Gtalen/computer_infrastructure/blob/main/weather.sh) file updating the weather data.\n",
    "  - Finally, the script commits and pushes changes to the repository in the [weather directory](https://github.com/Gtalen/computer_infrastructure/tree/main/data/weather).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Initial Testing and Error Handling\n",
    "  - The first execution encountered an error related to permission restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Modifications and Further Testing\n",
    "  - The workflow YAML file was updated to include a GitHub token for authentication.\n",
    "  - Permissions on my GitHub account were adjusted to allow the script to commit and push changes.\n",
    "  - After these modifications, testing was successful, and the automation runs smoothly."
